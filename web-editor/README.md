Local web editor for this Jekyll site.

Usage:
1. cd web-editor
2. npm install
3. npm start

Open http://localhost:4000 in your browser. The editor lists posts in `_posts`, lets you create new posts following the YYYY-MM-DD-title.md convention, edit and save them, and upload images into `assets/images/uploads`. Uploaded images are served under `/assets/...` so they will be available in your site source.
