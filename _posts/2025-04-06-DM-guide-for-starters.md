# The DM guide
I am a DM or a dungeon master, and here are some tips to make a fun campaign

These are 10 tips you can use.

1.Give detail such as “ you walk slowly through some blue tinted bushes carefully trying to be quiet”

2.Let there be more fun rolls like (stealth check’s)

3.You can include more NPCs like maybe a halfling named fungi (because he was born very funny)

4.Maybe you could make a totally new monster named the alpha

5.Or create abilities for the players

6.Maybe pets for the players

7.Or a new dimension

8.You could give your campaign a theme like (alien)

9.Describe the background a lot more detailed

10.This is a stretch if you have a 3D printer or a laser cutter you could design a custom map

P.S (You can make your map 3D)
