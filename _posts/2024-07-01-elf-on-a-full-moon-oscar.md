I drew this drawing during summer. at Shin Studio, Seattle WA, it was a digital art camp, for roughly 1 week. The people at the camp used an app called Procreate, we were asked to make a character of our choice, I thought of a vampire design, then to make it more kid friendly, I added a unicorn horn. I know that making blood is not the best choice since there may be children that are reading this, but they will have to get ready, there is lots of scary things in life but there may not be a way to avoid it.
